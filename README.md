## Notes

* My main struggle was just getting the layouts set up. Despite following the instruction to almost a T, it was still getting errors
  so it gave me limited time to work on other features. Beyond that, I had a really bad migrane while coding the other day and could
  barely see my screen due to blurred vision. But, other than that, I perserved and was able to implement additional features.
* I never had experience with calling APIs and utilizing networking, so it was an amazing learning experience and I'm glad that I learned a lot.
